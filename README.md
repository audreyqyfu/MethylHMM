# MethylHMM
The code here implements the Hidden Markov models (HMMs) for double-stranded DNA methylation data collected using hairpin-bisulfate PCR technique.  Our analysis fits a novel Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to the observed data, allowing for potential bisulfite conversion errors, and yields statistical estimates of parameters that quantify processivity of DNA methyltransferases (e.g., DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B in mammals) and substrate specificity.
